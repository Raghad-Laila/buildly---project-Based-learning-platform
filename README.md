# Buildly – Project-Based Programming Learning Platform

Buildly is an interactive educational platform designed to teach programming through real-world, project-based learning paths. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by guiding learners through structured, hands-on projects.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional programming education often lacks practical depth. Buildly addresses this by offering:

- Progressive learning paths: From beginner to expert, organized by topic (e.g., Web Development, AI).
- Real-world projects: Each project includes clear objectives, requirements, and estimated completion time.
- Integrated code editor: Learners can write and run code directly within the platform.
- Smart feedback: Instant evaluation and guidance to improve coding skills.
- User roles: Separate interfaces and permissions for learners and instructors.

## 🚀 Key Features

-  Structured learning paths with increasing complexity  
-  Realistic coding projects with clear deliverables  
-  Instructor dashboard for managing content and tracking progress  
-  Learner dashboard with personalized progress tracking  
-  Built-in code editor with execution and error feedback  
-  Authentication and role-based access control  

## 🚀 Tech Stack
